title: Who Am I & My Journey of Art

Hi. Whoever reading this. I am a person that love drawing weird stuff,  write weird story & blogs. (actrally no one really read it lol) I used Hexo to setup a personal blog before, but it's too fucking annoying to play around with these codes that I don't know, so I switched to LOFFER, a blog you can fork. It's based on Jekyll, and it's very simple to use. By the way, I use Github server to host my blog, so I don't need to pay extra money for hosting it. Setting up this is pretty darn easy, even adding a comment section. Although I know C++, everybody knows that we use HTML, CSS, and Javascript on web. It honestly bring a lot of problem. but with LOFFER & Disqus, I didn't expect it to be so easy that it honestly just cost me half an hour to do the entire thing. if you wanna set up a blog like this too, or you want to support the original creator of LOFFER, go to this link: [LOFFER PROJECT from FromEndWorld](https://github.com/FromEndWorld/LOFFER).

Update @ 24/5/2020: I wrote a blog myself using ruby! So I won't need to deal with stupid problems with that template anymore, I can fix it myself (or fuck it up myself).

# Drawing

I always liked to draw a lot in my childhood. It doesn't make me a master artist or something, but made me into the weird art kid in school. I'd say I'm pretty obsessed with anime, which made me even weirder.

## Starting point

My parents are all pretty cool about me drawing, they even send me to an sketching class when I was 12 or something. And I'll call this the official starting point of my art journey. I know this sentence make me sound like a art master talking about his great life or something like that, but this IS what I want to say.

in sketching class, I did what almost every child did in class -- draw cube, cylinder, and some other things like lamp and cup etc. but I quit after just more than a half year of studying, cause there is less and less time for me to use on drawing. I'm preparing for the middle school ability test, and it's pretty intense at that time I'd say.

## 抖抖村

Yeah I know this is a Chinese name but you shouldn't expect me to translate it cause it's freaking hard to do and I can't just write "shake shake town" on the title. This name is freaking awkward. In 2017 or 2018, maybe even later, I met this quality content producer. I just realized art is a subject, and it's hard as fuck. I realized if I want to draw, I need to learn anatomy, perspective, gesture, and many many other things. so I bought a tablet. it's a CTL-642 by Wacom, and I still use It today. so I'm pretty new at digital art I would say. It kinda broke a bit at the start of 2019, so I bought a ton of drawing supplies, and brought it to do a fix. and I finally decided I am gonna do digital art at that time, because I love art, and I don't have enough bucks to afford supplies used for triditional drawing (update: which is a terrible idea for doing drawabox).

And at that time, I did a dumb thing: faking that I am good at art. I did a bunch of silly things that does a little job on improving my art but looks dope. I just feel ashamed. Facebook likes is not more important than improving your art. Just don't fucking do that. you will feel ashamed for ages If you do that honestly.

## Drawabox

I'm doing this right now. Drawabox is really great for studying the basics of art, and I'm in L5 now. go check it out-> [drawabox official website](www.drawabox.com). It's based on constructional drawing and it's free, so it's perfect for a poor guy like me. And it's the time I realized there is a world "outside the firewall". Chinese goverment sets up a firewall for blocking many websites outside China that are "bad for them", but blocked many great, precious studying resources as well. I don't wanna oppose them for blocking "bad websites" outside China because they are gonna send me to jail if I dare oppose them. So I started to use VPN. I just being amazed by the world outside the firewall, youtube was a 404 website since when I even can't use computer. So I fond this website called Drawabox, it's not a dead website, It's running till now, and it have a super big Discord server so you should definitely try that.
