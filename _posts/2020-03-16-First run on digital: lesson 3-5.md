I just finished lesson 5 today, and I just feel like I need to write this. In this blog, I will talk about how I finished these lesson, and how these works in my opinion.
# disclamer
Update: Don't do these courses on digital if you don't wanna waste your time! this is a failed run and I got roasted by sven when I finished the wheel challenge. 

please don't. seriously. You'll waste your time.

# Lesson 3

lesson 3 is about plants. many plants are basically flat or twisted flat. For flat parts, we have the leves exercise, & for these 3d parts we have branches. Imo this lesson teaches how construction works, and how to alter between brief consturction & details. I actrally didn't struggle much in this lesson, the biggest problem I ever met is proportion problem. I coudn't capture the proportion in the picture accurate enough, so it cause heavily stiffness in my works. 

Here is an example of my first assignment from L3:

I cannot deny, this looks stiff as hell. the leaves live in a 3d space and I processed it as a 2 dementional paper-type thing. I actrally thought it like it was in 3d, but when I leave the reference to draw the subdivition of the leaves, everything just fell apart. I can't help thinking it as a 2d form.

& a example at the very end of L3, I struggled most on:

Yeah, this fricking cactus. this thing just smashed me. First, it's all made by 3d shapes, and second, there are little puff balls on the surface for spikes, it almost indecates the entire contour line of the form & roasted my lil' brain. It just directly shows all the things that I've been doing wrong and needs a understanding of 3d shapes, which I'm not familier with in L3 yet. I coudn't spot these mistakes by myself tho, so that's when the community plays its role. Kirito Akinema (in discord server "V-company") spotted the proportion problem. I wasn't realizing it until I directly slapped my sketch on reference. It's off by a lot. a HECK lot. And Meta (in drawabox official discord server) pointed out that these spikes aren't following the form. So I did a tracing first, then did another attempt:

The porpotion is finally reasonable. but these balls still aren't following the form very well. so whatsoever, I moved to L4.

# Lesson 4

lesson 4 is where you meet with 3d shapes, & basically using balls & sausages only to construct insects. (yeah yeah I know what ELSE you can construct with balls & sausages but this blog is family-friendly) It's all turning to 3d shapes now. I thought this lesson will punch me in my face, but surprisingly, no. I adapted to the method of constructing things in 3d quite quickly. at first, I thought I would have to do a LOT of tracing before finishing off a demo without tracing. but turned out that I got the hang of it after only one tracing. So I started to try out some demo. this is the first demo I tried.

The whole thing came out fairly nice for me, at least. although there are a few things came out proportion, it's impressive for me. to be honest, this is the award I craved for the entire journey of drawabox, that is to construct fairly complicated (for now) thing only by a picture. because of this, I basically did drawabox like consuming drugs in a spicific way. I AM suprised for be able to draw a box at any angle in L1, or to be able to copy a texture down in L2, but this is like my ultimate goal for my abslute beginner part of the journey. I am being able to construct a fricking insect! how impressive is that for me! 

I am not rushing, but purely addicted to drawabox. at L3, I basically tell me: well, you are gonna draw tonight, and just watching youtube for hours,  dodging the job that needed to be done. Surely, I am still impressed by these vehicles, and these are my next "ultimate" goal, but for now, I am willing to do this. Because of the corona virus outbreak, I'm sort of locked in my house since feburary I think. So, taking this chance, went through this lesson in 3 days (there are procrastinations, though)  and I didn't even felt tired. here is a quick showcase on my proudest assignment(still not good enough):

And then, I went to L5.

# Lesson 5

L5, animals. still enjoyable, but much, much harder. you can feel it in my first demo for lesson 5:

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/LYsKTSV/L5-showcase-1.png " ")

Clearly, there are some pure difficulties going on. Animals ARE like insects, but there are a lot of difference between them. these thoughts just popped up when I was drawing one of these animals. First, the main body parts you need to mark before adding these additional forms are fricking apart. by a LOT. I'm not making this if I have no sketching fundamentals. And even I have that, there are a lot of finger-on-screen measuring action going on. proportions just mess with me a lot during L5. Second, (I almost forgot I had a "First" going on) there are a FRICK lot of additional forms in animals. Unlike insects, animals have fats, muscles and a lot of other things, you name it. 

for now, line clearity is much more important now. I did a cat with some quite messy lines, and I regret it. don't do that. It messes with your head, with your final assignment quality, & a lot more. 

Birds are some easy ones, cause we see their torso & peivis as one sausage, so it's doesn't mess too much with your proportions, but quadrupeds are really tricky. in the first attempt, I moved my painting on top of the reference to be sure I'm right, cause I am terrified by the wulf demo. And here is my proudest drawing from L5, despite it's a meme, I still got effort in it.

I am done on Lesson 5 now, and I'm moving on to the 250 cylinder challenge, I hope I can do that without quitting.

# Special Thanks

I know this is not a movie or something that needs a "special thanks". but I NEED to mention these awesome people in DaB official discord server and in V-company. And special thanks for ImgBB for me to rape their servers using these 2000x2000 pixels pngs.

oh right, Typora is a really awsome markdown editor for me to write these blogs. Try it out if you are interested.

Update: I develop the website and write blogs on VScode now. It has version control integrated now, which means I won't need to push changes manually, and it's a awesome markdown editer too.
